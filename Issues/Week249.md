Happy Thursday! How are you?

I've seen so many good articles this week that it's been particularly hard to write this issue (sorry for the delay ðŸ˜…). Apple [rolled out public link invite to TestFlight](https://9to5mac.com/2018/09/26/testflight-public-links/), and we got a long and insightful article on the official Swift blog about [How Mirror Works](https://swift.org/blog/how-mirror-works/) by [@mikeash](https://twitter.com/mikeash/). Moreover, the [Swift 5.0 Release Process](https://swift.org/blog/5-0-release-process/) was announced, focusing on ABI stability.

We also got [@timacfr](https://twitter.com/timacfr)'s yearly analisys on [the presence of Swift in Apple's iOS apps](https://blog.timac.org/2018/0924-state-of-swift-ios12/) and the trends are positive.

As much as I would like, I just couldn't fit every interesting article in the newsletter. If you want to read all the suggested ones, you can do it, as always, [on our GitHub](https://github.com/iOS-Goodies/iOS-Goodies/blob/master/Issues/Week249.md).
