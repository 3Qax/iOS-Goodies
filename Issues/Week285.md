Happy Thursday! How was getting [iOS Goodies on a Tuesday](https://ios-goodies.com/post/185370134786/week-2845-wwdc-special)? It's a special week, full of new content, information if coming towards us from everywhere and it's quite hard to keep up to date with everything that's been announced. There are a few people who are going out of their way to process, organize and share the information in more accessible ways for everyone; I'm thinking here of [John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell) for his in-depth coverage of the event, [Kristina Fox](https://twitter.com/krstnfx) for her beautiful sketch notes for every session she attends, [Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws) for his impressive collection of tutorials and code samples for tech that's just been announced, [Anastasiia Voitova](https://twitter.com/vixentael) for her insights on the security-related news, [Michael Tsai](https://twitter.com/mjtsai) for gathering all the links and impressions in one place, and I'm sure there are many others too. They're all working hard at this and they deserve our gratitude. So if you got a lot of valuable information from someone's blog, tweets, podcast or video stream, make sure to tell them they're doing a great job ðŸ˜Š.

This edition of the newsletter has a special section called **WWDC**, linking to articles about new tech revealed at WWDC.
