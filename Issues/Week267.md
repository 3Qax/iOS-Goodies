Happy Thursday! So many things happened this week that it's hard to choose what to write about here. But I'll focus on the things that will actually have more impact our jobs as iOS developers and choose not to write about the FaceTime bug or the latest Facebook scandal ðŸ™ƒ. 

Last week, right after sending issue 266 of our newsletter, Apple announced the first beta of Xcode 10.2, which is very interesting for multiple reasons: first of all, it comes with Swift 5. This has a major impact on app thinning, because Swift apps will no longer include all the linked libraries, which will result in smaller apps. As found by [Patrick Balestra](https://twitter.com/BalestraPatrick), the difference [is quite noticeable](https://twitter.com/BalestraPatrick/status/1088565310691647489). And migration to Swift 5 seems to be quite smooth so far, but his could also be because the much talked about Result didn't make it to the first beta of Xcode 10.2. Besides those, other noteworthy changes are fixing the Asset Catalog issue that made apps build with Xcode 10 crash on iOS 9 and a adding a dark Xcode for light macOS option. Check the full [release notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode_release_notes/xcode_10_2_beta_release_notes) if you want to learn about all the new things.

In other news, iOS Goodies has had a Patreon running for the last almost 2 years. I want to thank all our patrons. Special thanks to Seth Cheeks for supporting us. As I have already informed our patrons, I have taken the decision to close down our Patreon. This will not affect iOS Goodies in any way, and we will continue to send our newsletter every Thursday.
