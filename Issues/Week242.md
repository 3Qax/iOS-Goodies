I was really impressed this week by [Nathan Gitter](https://twitter.com/nathangitter)'s work on building fluid interfaces. [The WWDC talk that inspired him](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/803/) is one of the most interesting ones this year (totally recommend it, btw), but it's more of a theoretical / inspirational / design session than a coding one. Nathan takes it one step further, writing an article and open sourcing the code for 8 interfaces that cover the topics in the presentation. You can find both of them below.
