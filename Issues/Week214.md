This was a very busy week in Apple news. First of all, the new [Swift forums are now open](https://swift.org/blog/forums/) and the old mailing lists were archived. Secondly, we've got the [first preview of iOS 11.3](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/01/apple-previews-ios-11-3/). This also means we got the [first beta of Xcode 9.3](https://developer.apple.com/download/), which requires you update to High Sierra. Here are the [API diffs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation?changes=latest_minor). As part of this, [ARKit got to version 1.5](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=01242018b), which brings, among others, vertical surface detection. Also, an [update to Swift Playgrounds app](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=01242018a) is available.

Last but not least, we got some fresh product news from Apple: [HomePod is launching on February 9, preorders start tomorrow](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/01/homepod-arrives-february-9-available-to-order-this-friday/). For those wondering why anyone would buy a smart speaker with an AI that's arguably behind its competitors, [this article](http://www.loopinsight.com/2018/01/24/on-homepod-and-audio-quality/) claims the audio technology inside the HomePod is state-of-the-art and only seen before in speakers with 5-figure price tags. I also like [Joe Cieplinski's take on this](http://joecieplinski.com/blog/2018/01/23/on-homepod/): "In order for Apple to win, Amazon and Google donâ€™t have to lose".
