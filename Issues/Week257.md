Happy Thursday! It's Thanksgiving today, and although we don't celebrate it in my area, I like the idea of taking some time to think what we're thankful for. Here are my very thematic ones: I'm thankful for our developer community, which creates an amazing amount of quality content every week; I'm thankful for the 3rd party apps that I use every day for the development process, making me more productive and helping me solve issues faster; and I'm thankful for the iPhone, a device I love to use and which allowed me to have a career writing software that runs on it; 

Usually, in this period you can find great deals and discounts on software or books. So keep an eye out and make sure to get what you want ðŸ˜„.
