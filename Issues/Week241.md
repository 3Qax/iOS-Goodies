There's a thing by Apple called the Affiliate Program. Through it, if you promoted eligible content such as apps, music, movies, TV shows, books from the App Store / iTunes / iBooks and referred customers to them, you would get a commission of the customers' purchase. But now, Apple decided to remove apps from that list. What does this mean? That there's no incentive for publications to write about the top apps in a segment, or, in general, to write about your app. Worst case scenario, this could be [the end of small and medium publications like TouchArcade](https://toucharcade.com/2018/08/01/apple-kills-the-app-store-affiliate-program-and-i-have-no-idea-what-we-are-going-to-do/). Others, [like MacStories, were big enough to adapt before this happened](https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1024791826077806592). We'll see how Apple's move plays in the long term for all of us. In the meantime, take [@viticci's advice](https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1024792617509433344) and support your favourite blog directly, by allowing their ads, buying their content or recommending them to your friends.
