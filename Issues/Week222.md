Good luck to all of you who have submitted their entry in the WWDC registration lottery. If you're a student or a member of STEM organization, you can apply for a scholarship starting next Monday. Also, make sure to read [Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws)'s [interview with people who attended previous WWDCs on a scholarship](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/60/want-to-win-a-wwdc-scholarship-previous-attendees-give-their-advice), I hope it will convince you to apply.

This week Apple [announced an integration between Core ML and  IBM Watson Services](https://developer.apple.com/ibm/), which can now be used to continuously train a model and give better results in time.

And if you're curious to try something else besides iOS development, this week's sponsor, [raywenderlich.com](https://www.raywenderlich.com/) has something for you. Make sure to check the sponsored link further down.
