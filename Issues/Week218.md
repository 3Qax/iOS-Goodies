Last week (right after we sent out iOS Goodies ðŸ˜…) Apple announced that starting with April 2018, [all new iOS apps submitted to the App Store must be built with the iOS 11 SDK](https://developer.apple.com/ios/submit/). So make sure to update your Xcode to the latest version :).

In other news, [Swift will participate in the Google Summer of Code program](https://twitter.com/tkremenek/status/966071276543492096). As someone who started doing iOS more seriously during GSoC 2013, I was extremely happy to hear that :). Developing a programming language in the open and encouraging students to contribute to it is something I really like about the "new" Apple and something I wouldn't have thought possible a few years ago.

Something I'd like to highlight this week is [Felix Krause](https://twitter.com/KrauseFx)'s work on security in iOS. His most recent article in this series, [Trusting third party SDKs](https://krausefx.com/blog/trusting-sdks) shows how important it is to be careful when adding third party SDKs to your app.
