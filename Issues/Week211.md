The biggest news of this week is probably that [Apple is buying buddybuild](https://www.buddybuild.com/blog/buddybuild-is-now-part-of-apple). [Buddybuild](https://www.buddybuild.com/) is one of the best CI/CD systems for mobile developers, and I can't wait to see it integarted in Apple's developer tools. However, this is also sad news for all their users, who now have 3 months to migrate their projects. [This thread](https://github.com/rnystrom/GitHawk/issues/1330) contains some good suggestions for alternatives.
