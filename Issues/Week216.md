I wasn't expecting to start an issue of iOS Goodies talking about emojis ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, but one of the biggest news of the week was what seemed to be a weird change in the way Apple applies the App Store review guidelines (not considering here Falcon Heavy's [successful test flight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbSwFU6tY1c) or launching a [Tesla into space](https://www.instagram.com/p/Be6VZEzgAEk/)). 

It started with a few app updates being rejected for not complying with the guidelines for using Apple's Trademarks and Copyrights. [Jeremy Burge](https://twitter.com/jeremyburge) wrote a comprehensive article about the situation on [Emojipedia](https://blog.emojipedia.org/apples-emoji-crackdown/). It seemed that using emojis in an app is ok only if it's typed by the user. However, one of the apps that got rejected [was approved](https://twitter.com/Sam0711er/status/961312320537415681) yesterday, emojis included. So now we're back at being confused üòÖ. A bit more consistency and clearer communication wouldn't hurt from Apple's app review team.
