Did you watch the Apple Event? I did, and I was really impressed by the energy it transmitted. And the products were very impressive too, in my opinion. There are already [benchmarks](https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1057901466025947136) that show the new iPads can easily match gaming PCs in processing power. I'm also a big fan of the shape of the new iPads, I like the fact that the're back to the iPhone 4 form factor. Really looking forward to seeing new apps for professionals that make good use of those new devices.

In other news this week, iOS 12.1 is out, with new emojis. And we also got Xcode 10.1. 

And last but not least before the links, [Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws), who seems to be on a mission to teach everyone Swift ðŸ˜„, has started gathering contributions to translate the Hacking With Swift tutorials to other languages. [Have a look and consider if you can help](https://github.com/twostraws/HWSTranslation) ðŸ˜Ž
