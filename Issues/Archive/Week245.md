It's almost September, and all the rumours point that the next Apple event will be on September 12. No official confirmation yet, though but I'm thinking that next week we should find out something official about this. No new Xcode 10 beta, but we got iOS 12 Beta 11. We're getting close to the iOS 12 launch, so make sure you test your apps! ðŸ˜„
