Happy Thursday, everyone ‚ò∫Ô∏è. I must begin this edition by talking about [Airbnb's series of articles on their experience with React Native](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/react-native-at-airbnb-f95aa460be1c), since they were shared dozens of times on my Twitter feed. You've probably seen them too :). First of all, I really appreciate that Airbnb wrote those articles. We usually see lots of similar articles when a big company adopts a technology, but we don't usually hear anything about their experience with it after a while. Those articles are well written and highlight both the good and the bad parts of using React Native at Airbnb. Secondly, their experience with React Native doesn't apply to everyone: we have the example of the Artsy engineering team, who [seem very happy with React Native](http://artsy.github.io/series/react-native-at-artsy/). 

And if you really want to know my personal opinion that shouldn't matter to you at all, I do prefer native development. But I also think there is a tool for every task, and for some tasks there might be better tools than the ones you're familiar with. Keep an open mind üòÑ
