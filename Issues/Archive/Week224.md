Xcode 9.3 is here, and with it, [Swift 4.1](https://swift.org/blog/swift-4-1-released/). This is something that many developers were looking forward to, especially for the `Equatable` and `Hashable` conformance. [Cosmin Pupăză](https://twitter.com/KaramazovShogun) wrote an article showing [What’s New in Swift 4.1?](https://www.raywenderlich.com/187826/whats-new-in-swift-4-1). Or, if you want an even more hands-on approach, check out [Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws)'s [Xcode playground with new Swift 4.1 features](https://github.com/twostraws/whats-new-in-swift-4-1).

We also saw the first alpha of [fastlane.ci](https://github.com/fastlane/ci/releases/tag/1.0.0.alpha.1), a mobile-oriented CI system to which we first linked to in [Issue 216](http://ios-goodies.com/post/170650959411/week-216). Impressive work to get to an alpha relese in 3 months.
