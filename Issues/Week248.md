As always, the week after Apple's September event is pretty busy. We got the official release of iOS 12, which I think is the most solid iOS release so far. It made my 6S so fast that I'm not even considering upgrading my device. iOS 12 may be worst thing for iPhone Xs sales ðŸ˜‚. Joke aside, hats off to all the Apple folks who worked on iOS 12, great work ðŸ‘Œ!

The release of iOS 12 also means we got the official [release of Swift 4.2](https://swift.org/blog/swift-4-2-released/). And what better time to dig into some of the [more obscure APIs of iOS 12](https://nshipster.com/ios-12/) with [@mattt](https://twitter.com/mattt)?
