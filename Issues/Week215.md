This week we saw the launch of [Point-Free](https://www.pointfree.co/), a Swift video series on functional programming by [Brandon Williams](https://www.twitter.com/mbrandonw) and [Stephen Celis](https://www.twitter.com/stephencelis). It's looking very good, and you can watch the first episode to decide if you want to subscribe or not. I've already added it to my watching list.

We have a few more iOS development / Swift articles this week, but I hope you'll enjoy reading them all ðŸ˜„.
