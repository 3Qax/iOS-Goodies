I've talked briefly lat week about the new iPads. [@JohnSundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell) show us a [quick example of live editing a game level](https://twitter.com/johnsundell/status/1060202832987611136) on the new iPad Pro, and I think this is just awesome. I'm very curious to see some more creative usages of the new devices.

In other news, I'm very happy to see that, for the second year in a row, we're nominated to the [Swift Community Awards](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/awards) in the Best Newsletter category. We consider this a result of our commitment to deliver the best iOS development articles every Thursday to our subscribers, and it means a lot to us.
