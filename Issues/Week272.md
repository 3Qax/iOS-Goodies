Happy Thursday! Our partners at [@skillsmatter](https://twitter.com/skillsmatter), who organize iOSCon [have published the final schedule of the conference](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/10823-ioscon-2019-the-conference-for-ios-and-swift-developers#program), and the line-up of speakers is very impressive, a perfect mix between up-and-coming and established members of our community. Deciding which sessions to attend seems really complicated. I look forward to meeting as many of you as possible there, so if you see me, make sure to say hi. There's a chance I'll have some iOS Goodies stickers ðŸ˜‰.
