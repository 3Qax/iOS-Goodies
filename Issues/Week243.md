Happy Thursday! Another week, another packed iOS Goodies issue üòÑ. As last week, not all the articles could make it into the newsletter. You can read all of them on [GitHub](https://github.com/iOS-Goodies/iOS-Goodies/edit/master/Issues/Week243.md).

There's a new podcast in the iOS community - [Contravariance](https://contravariance.rocks/) by [Benedikt Terhechte](https://twitter.com/terhechte) and [Bas Broek](https://twitter.com/BasThomas). We're wishing them good luck, and many more episodes.

One article that got my attention this week was [Joe Cieplinski](http://twitter.com/jcieplinski)'s [Say Hello to RECaf](https://joecieplinski.com/blog/2018/08/15/say-hello-to-recaf/). One could see it as a teaser for an app, but I chose to see the quality of Joe's analysis of a caffeine tracking app. Those bullet points are some of the best plans for making an app I've seen. And I'm very glad he shared them with everyone üòÑ.
