I was writing last week about the "new Apple", that has Swift take part as an organization to the Gogle Summer of Code. On the same note, this week, [Norman Maurer](https://twitter.com/normanmaurer) from Apple gave [a talk](https://twitter.com/Chris__Bailey/status/969090062972469249) at try! Swift Tokyo in which he announced [swift-nio](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio), an open source low-level networking framework. So Apple just announced and open sourced a framework at a conference that's not WWDC üò≤. That's in addition to lots of members of the Swift team who are guests on various podcasts, or give talks at other conferences. Moreover, Apple is [asking for feedback](https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/97662) on the networking APIs. Make sure to contribute if you have something to say. 

Keep up the good work and the openness, Apple üëç! The community really appreciates this üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
