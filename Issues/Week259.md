Happy Thursday! I didn't have enough space to fit this in last week, but I'll do it now. Like every year, [App Store Connect will be on vacation December 23 to 27 (Pacific Time)](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=11272018). So make sure to schedule you releases in time, or don't plan any update in that period.
